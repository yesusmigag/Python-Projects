"""Python has two built-in functions named min and max that work with sequences. 
The min function accepts a sequence, such as a list, as an argument and returns 
the item that has the lowest value in the sequence."""

# MIN Item
my_list = [5, 4, 3, 2, 50, 40, 30]
print('The lowest value is', min(my_list))

#display The lowest value is 2

print('--------------------------')

#MAX Item
my_list = [5, 4, 3, 2, 50, 40, 30]
print('The highest value is', max(my_list))

#display The highest value is 50
