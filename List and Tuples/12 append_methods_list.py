Method              	Description

append(item)------------Adds item to the end of the list.
index(item)-------------Returns the index of the first element whose value is equal to item. 
                        A ValueError exception is raised if item is not found in the list.
insert(index, item)-----Inserts item into the list at the specified index. When an item is inserted into a list, 
                        the list is expanded in size to accommodate the new item. The item that was previously at 
                        the specified index, and all the items after it, are shifted by one position toward the end 
                        of the list.
                        No exceptions will occur if you specify an invalid index. If you specify an index beyond 
                        the end of the list, the item will be added to the end of the list. If you use a negative 
                        index that specifies an invalid position, the item will be inserted at the beginning of the list.
sort()------------------Sorts the items in the list so they appear in ascending order (from the lowest value to the highest value).
remove(item)------------Removes the first occurrence of item from the list. A ValueError exception is raised if item is not found in the list.
reverse()---------------Reverses the order of the items in the list.   """


#The append Method is commonly used to add items to a list. The item that 
#is passed as an argument is appended to the end of the listâ€™s existing elements  
   
# This program demonstrates how the append
# method can be used to add items to a list.
def main():
# First, create an empty list.
   name_list = []
   # Create a variable to control the loop.
   again = 'Y'

   # Add some names to the list.
   while again.upper() == 'Y':

    # Get a name from the user.
    name = input('Enter a name: ')

    # Append the name to the list.
    name_list.append(name)

    # Add another one?
    print('Do you want to add another name?')
    again = input('y = yes, anything else = no: ')   
    print()

    # Display the names that were entered.
    print('Here are the names you entered.')
